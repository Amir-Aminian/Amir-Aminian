Hi :wave: I am Amir. Not a long ago, I decided to pursue my interest in tech with the help of [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca/). Please follow me through this journey.

## My Projects

### [Schedule Assistant (Backend)](https://schedule-assistant.link/):
    How I have learned Node.js, Express.js, MySQL Workbench, WebSocket, JWT, Service Worker, Push and WebPush Notifications.
    It is built upon the foundation of my previous project.
